Ever get tired of manual data entry into the Quickbooks system?

Sometimes its much easier to do the bookkeeping inside Microsoft excel and then have it copied and pasted to the Quickbooks system.  It is much more efficient and less time consuming method.  How does this work? 

For example, let’s say that you need to create 100 invoices for Monday’s billing.  Your accountant can create an excel based spreadsheet listing the minimal essentials:  date, customer name, product/service, amount, split lines, etc. and save this template for future reference.  Then the data can be copied and pasted into a table format that integrates into the Quickbooks system saving a loads of time.
