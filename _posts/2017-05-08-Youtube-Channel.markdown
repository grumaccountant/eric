Its been nearly two years since my last posting.  My wife is expecting our first child, and I had been fairly committed to a two-year project
that left minimal time to do upkeep on my website.  With my schedule freeing up some, I've launched a Youtube channel for Quickbooks 
instructive tutorials. What makes my videos different from other channels is that its focus is on inception of one company as it grows
larger through increasing transactions.
<p>
The video series is meant to be coherent and centered around the full utilization of Quickbooks, which also includes the QBXML language, 
which is being replaced by online alternatives.  The channel is meant to be entertaining and also a usable base of material that I can reference 
my clientele to avail themselves.
<p>
In practice I have noticed that there lacks proper illustrative instruction on how to use various Quickbooks features practically and succinctly.
