Donor statements run from Quickbooks?  Yes it can!
When I worked in public accounting many non-profit organizations used separate software to manage their donor lists for fund raising, contributions, capital campaigns, and pledges such as Giftworks, eTapestry, Raiser’s Edge, or other specialized products.  Using a second software package often resulted in differences between Quickbooks and the other software.  There is nothing more frustrating than providing inconsistent information to donors.  

One of the little known features in Quickbooks is that most information can be queried from its internal database into usable information.  The queried information is transferred into donor statements by pulling the payment information directly into the thank you template.  The benefits are listed below:
1.	 Limited customization that results in donor statements  with payment history data included.
2.	 One system results in cost savings.
3.	 Hassle free installation and operation.   

A company called BigRed Consulting has developed a fairly innovative solution to query payment data from an existing Quickbooks file into donor ready statements.  Check out their information below which is complete with screenshots of their product line.
