Mission:
My mission is to provide outcome based solutions to small business owners in Bangor Maine.  My Firm  supports small business owners that want to maintain control over cash inflows and outflows and outsource their data entry.
<p>
Ideal:
Low key businesses with large volume transactions and minimal data entry accomplished through Quickbooks importing capabilities.  Setting up the chart of accounts, items list, receipts and payables correctly on the front end allows for detailed internal and external reporting arising from automated data entry.  
<p>
Vision:
As your company grows in volume the accounting remains simple.  Simplicity is accomplished through data importation into a properly set-up file.  Whether youâ€™re creating 10, 100, or 1,000 invoices a day, the process remains the same and is scalable with volume.  More volume does not mean more work.
