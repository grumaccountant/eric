<h3><b>Mission:</b></h3><p>
My mission is to provide outcome based solutions to small business owners in and around Bangor Maine.  
My Firm  supports small business owners that want to maintain control over cash inflows and outflows and outsource their data entry.
<p>
<h3><b>Ideal:</b></h3><p>
Low key businesses with large volume transactions and minimal data entry accomplished through Quickbooks importing capabilities.  Setting up the chart of accounts, items list, receipts and payables correctly on the front end allows for detailed internal and external reporting arising from automated data entry.  
<p>
<h3><b>Vision:</b></h3><p>
As your company grows in volume the accounting remains simple.  Simplicity is accomplished through data importation into a properly set-up file.  Whether you’re creating 10, 100, or 1,000 invoices a day, the process remains the same and is scalable with volume.  More volume does not mean more work.

<h3><b>My history and experience:</b></h3><p>
I am an Old Town native and graduated from Old Town High School in 2001 and pursued a business degree at the University of Maine in Orono.  Afterwards, I began my career with the National Credit Union Administration as an examiner in and around Augusta, Maine.  Later I worked for my Dad at his consulting firm, before beginning my foray into Public Accounting by working seven years for Edwards, Faust, and Smith CPAs. My experience includes audits and assurance, tax, computer services, and business consulting services. 
<p>


<h3><b>General  view of Quickbooks:</b></h3><p>
I’m very comfortable with the Quickbooks system and confident that it can meet most business and nonprofit needs.  If the base package is not sufficient, customized add-ons can either be purchased in the marketplace or built for your specific needs.
<p>

<h3><b>What differentiates me from other accountants?</b></h3><p>
My focus is on optimized outcomes that result in boring, consistent, and comparable performance.  The accounting system should operate similar to a robotic process automation that is free of human interference.  Data should be accurate on the front-end with little-to-no back-end correction.  Real-time reporting provides decision makers with that extra edge.
